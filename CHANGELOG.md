### Backend - Database Schema Alignment & API Error Resolution

**Task Context:** Fixed SQL errors in the storefront product detail API by ensuring the database schema is fully synchronized with the required columns and data types.

**Summary of Work:**
- Identified and fixed multiple SQL errors in product detail API endpoints related to missing columns and schema mismatches.
- Created and applied multiple migrations to add missing columns to database tables:
  - Added `category` and `parent_category_id` columns to appropriate tables
  - Added `data_ai_hint` and `approval_status` columns to products table
  - Added `platform_category_id` and `default_variant_id` columns to products table
  - Added `merchant_id` column (UUID FK to users) to products table
  - Added `price` column to product_variants table
- Performed comprehensive audit of database schema against `schema.sql` and code queries
- Updated `schema.sql` to match actual database structure:
  - Changed products.id from VARCHAR(255) to SERIAL
  - Changed product_variants.product_id from VARCHAR(255) to INTEGER
  - Changed users.id from VARCHAR(255) to UUID with default gen_random_uuid()
  - Removed password_salt column from users table
  - Added is_superuser column to users table
  - Updated constraints and indexes
- Created comprehensive migration script to ensure all development and test databases are aligned with the updated schema
- Granted appropriate permissions to the moobuser role
- Verified that the storefront product detail API endpoint returns correct product data without errors

**Next Steps:**
- Review and smoke-test remaining API endpoints for SQL errors
- Update test database setup in conftest.py to match schema changes
- Run test suite and fix any remaining failures

### AI Shopper UI - Initial Focus & Manual Testing

**Task Context:** Shift focus from backend test debugging to solidifying and manually testing the AI Shopper frontend UI.

**Next Steps:**
- Solidify the AI Shopper UI components and user flow within the Next.js frontend.
- Conduct manual testing of UI interactions (e.g., sending messages, receiving responses, displaying products, handling errors) to identify any obvious issues or areas for improvement.
- Based on manual testing, establish clear test standards and identify specific test cases for future automated UI testing (e.g., using Cypress).
- Document findings and potential UI bugs or enhancements.

### Backend - Wallet Authentication Test Debugging (Paused)

**Summary of Recent Work:**
- Continued debugging of failing wallet signature verification tests in `fastapi_ai_backend/tests/test_auth.py`.
- Investigated and corrected `unittest.mock.patch` targets for the `verify_wallet_signature` function.
- Initial attempts to patch at the usage site (`fastapi_ai_backend.app.routers.auth.verify_wallet_signature`) were made.
- Shifted strategy to patch `verify_wallet_signature` at its source module (`fastapi_ai_backend.app.security.verify_wallet_signature`) for `test_link_wallet_account_already_has_different_wallet`.
- The last test run with this source-patched mock was interrupted before full results were observed.

**Last Known State (from previous changelog entry):**
- Several tests were still failing with `422 Unprocessable Entity` errors.
- Custom validators in `app/models/auth_models.py::WalletLoginSchema` were under review.
- Some `signed_message` fields in `tests/test_auth.py` might still need correction to valid 132-character hex strings.
- `wallet_address` validation regex in `WalletLoginSchema` was also under scrutiny.

**Next Steps (When Resuming Backend Tests):**
1.  **Verify Mocking Strategy:** Confirm if patching `verify_wallet_signature` at `fastapi_ai_backend.app.security.verify_wallet_signature` consistently resolves "Invalid signature" errors for all relevant tests. Apply this patch strategy to all affected tests if successful.
2.  **Address Remaining 422s:** If `422 Unprocessable Entity` errors persist after mocks are fixed, continue investigating Pydantic schema validation issues for `wallet_address` and `signed_message` in `auth_models.py` and `test_auth.py`.
3.  **Fix Agent Test:** Address the `column p.platform_category_id does not exist` error in `tests/agents/test_ai_shopping_assistant_agent.py`.
4.  **Goal:** Ensure all backend tests pass reliably.

### Backend - Wallet Authentication Debugging (Paused)

**Task Context:** Resolving multiple backend test failures in `tests/test_auth.py` related to wallet authentication in the FastAPI project. This involves correcting Pydantic schema validation issues, especially around wallet signature length and format, and debugging 422 Unprocessable Entity errors.

**Last Known State:**
- Several tests are still failing with `422 Unprocessable Entity` errors.
- Custom validators in `app/models/auth_models.py::WalletLoginSchema` were restored with debug print statements.
- Attempts were made to update all `signed_message` fields in `tests/test_auth.py` to be valid 132-character hex strings (e.g., `"0x" + "a" * 130`).
- Debug output from the last test run (interrupted) showed:
    - Persistent `DEBUG: Invalid wallet_address format: 0x...` errors for multiple tests. The wallet addresses are generated using `f"0x{uuid.uuid4().hex[:40]}".lower()`, which should match the regex `r"^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$"`. This discrepancy needs investigation.
    - `DEBUG: Invalid signed_message hex format: sig` for `test_link_wallet_new_wallet_already_used_by_other` and `test_link_wallet_same_wallet_already_linked_and_verified`.
    - `DEBUG: Invalid signed_message hex format: invalid_sig` for `test_link_wallet_invalid_signature`.
    - These indicate that some `signed_message` values in `tests/test_auth.py` were not correctly updated to the 132-character hex format.

**Next Steps (When Resuming This Task):**
1.  **Correct `signed_message` values:** Ensure all instances of `signed_message` in `tests/test_auth.py` (specifically in `test_link_wallet_new_wallet_already_used_by_other`, `test_link_wallet_invalid_signature`, and `test_link_wallet_same_wallet_already_linked_and_verified`) are updated to valid 132-character hex strings.
2.  **Investigate `wallet_address` validation:** Determine why the `wallet_address_must_be_valid_ethereum_address` validator in `WalletLoginSchema` is failing for seemingly correct addresses. Check the regex and its application carefully.
3.  **Systematic Debugging:** Rerun tests and analyze debug output and FastAPI validation error responses to pinpoint the exact cause of each remaining 422 error.
4.  **Adjust Test Data & Assertions:** Modify test payloads and expected status codes based on findings.
5.  **Goal:** Ensure all wallet login and linking tests in `tests/test_auth.py` pass successfully.
