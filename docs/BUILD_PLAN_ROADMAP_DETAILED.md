# TAIC Platform: Build Plan Roadmap (Updated)

## 1. Introduction & Vision

This document outlines the strategic build plan for the TAIC (Transformative AI Commerce) platform. It serves as a consolidated roadmap, integrating insights from the comprehensive documentation review. It aligns development efforts with the platform's evolving architecture and database schema (`schema.sql`). Its purpose is to guide the phased development of new features and enhancements, ensuring a cohesive and strategic approach to building a robust, scalable, and innovative e-commerce solution.

The overall vision for the TAIC platform is to be a global e-commerce ecosystem powered by blockchain technology and enhanced by artificial intelligence. Key pillars of this vision include:
*   **Empowering Global Merchants:** Providing tools for entrepreneurs and businesses worldwide to establish their online presence, manage products (including variants and services), and reach a global customer base.
*   **Seamless Crypto & Fiat Integration:** Supporting TAIC cryptocurrency as a primary payment method alongside traditional fiat currency options, offering flexibility and choice to users.
*   **Incentivized Shopping Experience:** Leveraging cashback rewards in TAIC cryptocurrency to drive user engagement and loyalty.
*   **AI-Driven Enhancements:** Utilizing a sophisticated, hybrid AI agent architecture. Core backend agents (Shopping Assistant, Product Service) are built with FastAPI and MCP for robust, scalable services. Specific, self-contained AI flows (VTO, Idea Generators) are built with Genkit and exposed via Next.js for model-agnostic flexibility.
*   **Multi-Vendor Marketplace:** Establishing a comprehensive marketplace where multiple merchants can list products, subject to admin approval, fostering a diverse and competitive environment.

This build plan is the primary source for future planning and development tracking.

## 2. Definition of Production Ready (MVP)

*   **Known Issues / Bugs:**
    *   **Price Display Consistency (TAIC Suffix):**
        *   **Description:** Ensured product prices on the detail page use 'TAIC' as a suffix (e.g., '8.38 TAIC') for consistency with the product listing page.
        *   **Impact:** Improves UI consistency.
        *   **Status:** `[FIXED]` - Updated `src/app/products/[id]/page.tsx`.

    *   **Product Variant Attribute Naming:**
        *   **Description:** Variant attributes (e.g., colors, sizes) were displayed on the frontend with generic placeholder names like "Color 1" instead of their actual values. This was due to a regression that was subsequently reverted.
        *   **Status:** `[FIXED]`
        *   **Impact:** Critical. Prevented shoppers from making informed purchasing decisions on products with variants.

            *   A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) has been set up to automatically run backend tests on pushes and pull requests to the main branches.
    *   **Requirements for Running & Maintaining Tests (Backend - FastAPI):**
        *   **Environment Setup:**
            *   Ensure Python 3.11 (or as specified in `fastapi_ai_backend/.python-version`) is installed.
            *   A running PostgreSQL instance accessible to the test environment (connection details typically managed via environment variables like `DATABASE_URL` or individual `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, etc., for the test database).
        *   **Running Tests:**
            *   Navigate to the `fastapi_ai_backend` directory.
            *   Execute `./run_tests.sh`. This script will create/update the virtual environment, install dependencies, and run pytest.
            *   Alternatively, activate the venv (`source venv/bin/activate`) and run `pytest` directly.
        *   **Adding New Tests:**
            *   Follow pytest conventions for test file (`test_*.py`) and test function (`test_*`) naming.
            *   Place new backend tests in appropriate subdirectories within `fastapi_ai_backend/tests/`.
            *   Utilize existing fixtures in `conftest.py` for database access (`test_db`, `client`, `auth_client`, `verbose_db_conn`) and HTTP client interactions.
            *   Ensure new Pydantic models or dependencies are added to `requirements.txt` and/or `requirements-test.txt` as needed.
            *   Update `scripts/seed_test_db.py` if new foundational data is required for tests.
    *   **Next Steps (Testing):**
        *   **Backend (FastAPI & Next.js API Routes):**
            *   Expand Pytest coverage for all remaining FastAPI backend API endpoints, service logic, and AI agent interactions.
            *   Implement integration tests for critical Next.js API routes, particularly for Genkit-based AI features like Virtual Try-On (VTO).

## Wallet Login Modal - UI/UX Investigation (as of 2025-06-14)

**Objective**: Ensure wallet login is user-friendly and behaves consistently. Currently, the primary concern is the modal opening in a new window under certain conditions.

**Current Findings**:
*   **Trigger**: The wallet connection modal (Web3Modal) is triggered from:
    *   `/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` (when "Connect Wallet & Log In" is clicked).
    *   `/src/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx` (when "Connect Wallet & Register" is clicked).
    *   `/src/components/dashboard/ProfileSection.tsx` (for linking a wallet to an existing account).
*   **Web3Modal Configuration**:
    *   Initialized in `/src/components/providers/Web3ModalProvider.tsx`.
    *   Current configuration includes theme settings but no explicit display mode options that would prevent new windows.
*   **Observed Behavior (Phantom Wallet)**:
    *   **Chrome**: When Phantom Wallet is selected from Web3Modal, it opens its UI in a **new, separate browser window**. This behavior is likely controlled by the Phantom Chrome extension itself.
    *   **Firefox**: When Phantom Wallet is selected, it appears to integrate more smoothly (details to be confirmed, but user reported it "worked fine," implying no new window).
*   **Hypothesis**: The "new window" behavior with Phantom in Chrome is specific to that extension's design in that browser environment and may not be directly controllable by Web3Modal's configuration.

**Outstanding Questions / Next Steps for Investigation**:
*   **MetaMask Test (Chrome)**:
    *   Verify if selecting MetaMask in Chrome also results in a new browser window or if it uses the standard extension pop-up. This will help determine if the issue is Phantom-specific or more general to Chrome.
*   **MetaMask Test (Firefox)**:
    *   Verify MetaMask behavior in Firefox for a complete comparison.
*   **Phantom Behavior in Firefox (Details)**:
    *   Confirm the exact behavior of Phantom in Firefox (e.g., in-page overlay, extension pop-up).
*   **User Experience (UX) for Login/Register Pages**:
    *   Review the default presentation on `/login` (currently defaults to "Login with Wallet") and `/register` (defaults to email form).
    *   Consider a more balanced initial presentation of login/registration options (e.g., Email/Password, Wallet, Register links clearly and neutrally presented).
*   **Expectation Setting**:
    *   If new window behavior is unavoidable for certain wallets/browsers, consider adding a small UI note to inform users (e.g., "Wallet interactions may open your extension or a new window.").

**Proposed Solution Path (High-Level)**:
1.  Complete the above tests to fully understand cross-browser and cross-wallet behavior.
2.  Based on findings, if the "new window" issue is largely uncontrollable (due to extension behavior):
    *   Focus on improving the on-page UX for selecting login/registration methods.
    *   Implement UI notes to set user expectations.
3.  If any Web3Modal configuration changes *can* mitigate undesirable behavior without breaking functionality, explore and test them.
4.  Update this section with definitive findings and a concrete implementation plan.
