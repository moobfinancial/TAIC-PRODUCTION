# TAIC Platform: Product Ideas & Feature Deep Dives

This document captures detailed product ideas, strategic considerations, and feature deep dives that complement the main `PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md`.

## 1. AI Idea Generator (Product Idea vs. Gift Idea Modes)

**Date:** 2025-06-08

**Context:**
The AI Idea Generator tool, currently marketed on the `/ai-product-ideas` page, has underlying technology (LLM, Genkit flow, product catalog access) that can serve distinct user needs based on its "mode" or system prompt.

**Core Distinction:**

*   **"Product Idea" Mode (Innovation Focus):**
    *   **Current Persona:** "Product innovation expert."
    *   **Target Audience:** Merchants/Sellers, Entrepreneurs, Product Designers/Developers.
    *   **Value Proposition:** Helps generate new product concepts, refine existing ideas, explore market niches, and innovate.
    *   **Strategic Placement:** Ideal as a feature within the **Merchant Portal**.
    *   **Roadmap Alignment:** Supports the goals of empowering merchants and enhancing the Merchant Portal (Phase 2 of `PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md`).

*   **"Gift Idea" Mode (Discovery Focus):**
    *   **Target Audience:** Shoppers on the e-commerce platform.
    *   **Value Proposition:** Helps shoppers find suitable gifts based on occasion, recipient details, interests, etc. Solves a common shopper problem.
    *   **Strategic Placement:** Integrated into the main shopper experience (e.g., via AI Shopping Assistant, standalone tool).
    *   **Roadmap Alignment:** Directly aligns with the "Gift Recommendation Agent" planned under "Phase C (Advanced Capabilities)" of the AI Architecture in `PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md`.

**Key Considerations & Future Enhancements for Shoppers:**

If "idea generation" is to be further developed for shoppers beyond gift ideas, it might involve:
*   **"Product Use-Case Ideas":** e.g., "I bought X, what are some creative ways to use it?"
*   **"Product Customization Ideas":** e.g., "How can I personalize product Y?"
*   **"Solution Finder / Needs-Based Discovery":** e.g., "I need ideas for organizing my small kitchen." This would be a more advanced search/recommendation feature.

**Actionable Insights:**
*   The informational page `/ai-product-ideas` serves as a general marketing front for this capability.
*   The actual interactive tool should be strategically placed and its modes clearly differentiated based on the target user (shopper vs. merchant).
*   The underlying Genkit flow can be adapted with different system prompts to power these distinct modes.
