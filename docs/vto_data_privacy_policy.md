# Virtual Try-On (VTO) Data Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** [Date of Last Update]

## 1. Introduction

This Virtual Try-On (VTO) Data Privacy Policy explains how TAIC ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, stores, and protects images and associated data provided by you ("user," "you") or generated when you use our Virtual Try-On feature. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the transparency of our data handling practices related to this specific feature.

This policy is a supplement to our main Privacy Policy and applies specifically to the VTO feature.

## 2. What Information We Collect

When you use the VTO feature, we may collect the following types of information:

*   **User-Uploaded Images:**
    *   Images you voluntarily upload to the VTO system. These are typically photos of yourself intended for use as the base for the virtual try-on.
    *   We may store metadata associated with these images, such as filename and image type (e.g., 'user_profile_for_vto').
*   **Generated VTO Images:**
    *   Images created by our VTO system, which combine your uploaded image with a digital representation of a product you have selected to virtually "try on."
    *   Metadata for these images may include a reference to the product tried on and the type 'generated_vto_result'.

## 3. How We Use Your Images

Your images (both uploaded and generated) are used for the following specific purposes:

*   **To Provide VTO Functionality:** The primary use of your images is to enable the VTO feature, allowing you to see a simulation of how a product might look on you.
*   **To Generate VTO Results:** Your uploaded image is processed with the selected product image to create the virtual try-on composite image.
*   **Temporary Processing:** Images may be temporarily processed by our backend systems (including potentially Google's Genkit/Gemini based AI models, if used for VTO generation) to perform the try-on simulation.

**Important Limitations on Use:**

*   **No AI Model Training (Without Explicit Consent):** Your uploaded images and generated VTO images are **NOT** used to train our or any third-party artificial intelligence (AI) models unless we obtain your explicit, separate, and informed consent for such a purpose.
*   **No Identification or Other Purposes:** We do not use these images for user identification, facial recognition (beyond what is necessary for the VTO feature itself, e.g., pose detection for overlay), or any other purposes not directly related to providing and improving the VTO experience.
*   **No Sale of Images:** We will never sell your VTO-related images.

## 4. Data Storage and Security

*   **Storage Location:** Images uploaded for VTO and images generated by the VTO system are stored securely on our platform's servers (or designated secure cloud storage providers).
*   **Security Measures:** We implement reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect your images from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. These may include:
    *   Access controls to limit who can access image data.
    *   Encryption of images at rest and in transit (details to be specified based on actual implementation).
    *   Regular security assessments.
*   **Metadata Storage:** Image metadata (as defined in our `schema.sql` for the `vto_images` table) is stored in our platform database with appropriate security controls.

## 5. Data Retention and Deletion

Our policy for retaining and deleting VTO-related images is as follows:

*   **User-Uploaded Images (e.g., your photo):**
    *   **Policy Option 1 (Session-Based):** User-uploaded images are deleted immediately after the VTO session ends or shortly thereafter (e.g., within [Specify Timeframe, e.g., 24 hours]).
    *   **Policy Option 2 (User-Managed with Expiry):** User-uploaded images may be stored for a defined period (e.g., [Specify Timeframe, e.g., 30 days]) to allow you to reuse them for subsequent VTO sessions or view past try-ons. After this period, they may be automatically deleted. You will also have the option to delete these images manually from your account dashboard at any time.
    *   **Policy Option 3 (Explicit User Deletion Only):** User-uploaded images are stored until you explicitly delete them via your account dashboard. An `expires_at` field may be set if an automatic deletion policy is also in place after a longer period of inactivity or storage.
    *   **(TAIC's Chosen Policy - To Be Determined & Specified Here based on implementation choice. For now, let's assume Option 2 as a balanced approach for the document):** "User-uploaded images are stored for a period of [e.g., 30 days] to allow you to reuse them for VTO sessions. You can delete your uploaded VTO images at any time from your user profile settings. Images not actively used or deleted by you may be subject to automatic deletion after [e.g., 90 days] of inactivity or based on our general data retention policies."
*   **Generated VTO Images (user image + product):**
    *   These images may be stored for a similar period as user-uploaded images to allow you to review, save, or share your try-on results.
    *   They are subject to the same deletion mechanisms (user-initiated or automatic expiry) as defined for user-uploaded images.
    *   The `expires_at` timestamp in our database may be used to manage automatic deletion.

## 6. Sharing of Your Images

TAIC is committed to not sharing your VTO-related images with third parties, except in the following limited circumstances:

*   **Service Providers:** We may use third-party service providers for the technical operation of the VTO service itself (e.g., cloud hosting for image storage, AI models for image processing if not fully in-house). These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and are not permitted to use your images for their own purposes. (If Genkit/Gemini is used via Google Cloud, Google's terms of service and data processing agreements would apply and should be referenced).
*   **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your images if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or subpoena).

We will **not** share your VTO images with other users or make them publicly visible without your explicit consent (e.g., if you choose to share a VTO result on social media through a platform feature).

## 7. User Rights

You have certain rights regarding your VTO images, subject to local data protection laws:

*   **Right to Access:** If your images are stored, you have the right to access them, typically through your user account dashboard.
*   **Right to Deletion:** You have the right to delete your uploaded VTO images and generated VTO results that are stored by us, typically through your user account dashboard.
*   **Right to Withdraw Consent:** If the VTO feature relies on explicit consent for a specific type of processing (e.g., AI model training, if ever introduced), you have the right to withdraw that consent.

To exercise these rights, please use the tools provided in your account settings or contact us using the information below.

## 9. Policy Updates

We may update this VTO Data Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. If we make material changes, we will notify you by posting the updated policy on our platform or by other means as appropriate. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
