## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for migrating three key components from Genkit to the new FastAPI/MCPUs/A2A architecture. The migration aims to improve maintainability, performance, and flexibility while maintaining or enhancing existing functionality.

## 1. Shopping Assistant

### Current Implementation
- **Location**: `src/ai/flows/shopping-assistant.ts`
- **Technology Stack**:
  - Genkit for LLM orchestration
  - Custom prompt engineering
  - Integrated with product catalog
- **Key Features**:
  - Processes natural language queries
  - Provides product recommendations
  - Handles clarification requests
  - Manages conversation state

### Goals
1. **Enhanced Product Discovery**
   - More accurate product matching
   - Better handling of ambiguous queries
   - Support for advanced filtering

2. **Improved Performance**
   - Reduced latency in responses
   - Better error handling
   - Improved scalability

3. **Merchant Integration**
   - Showcase merchant-specific inventory
   - Support for merchant-specific promotions
   - Inventory-aware recommendations

### Migration Strategy
1. **New Architecture**:
   ```
   Next.js Frontend → FastAPI Gateway → Shopping Assistant MCP → Product Service MCP
   ```

2. **Key Components**:
   - **FastAPI Gateway**: Handle authentication, rate limiting
   - **Shopping Assistant MCP**: Core recommendation logic
   - **Product Service MCP**: Product search and retrieval

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - [ ] Create Shopping Assistant MCP
   - [ ] Implement product search service
   - [ ] Migrate prompt engineering logic
   - [ ] Update frontend integration
   - [ ] Implement A/B testing framework

## 2. Product Idea Generator

### Current Implementation
- **Location**: `src/ai/flows/product-idea-generator.ts`
- **Purpose**: Helps merchants generate product ideas
- **Features**:
  - Generates new product concepts
  - Can suggest improvements to existing products
  - Uses merchant inventory as context

### Goals
1. **Merchant-Centric**
   - Leverage merchant's existing inventory
   - Consider local market trends
   - Align with merchant's brand identity

2. **Data-Driven**
   - Analyze sales performance
   - Consider seasonality
   - Factor in supplier capabilities

3. **Actionable Outputs**
   - Detailed product specifications
   - Pricing recommendations
   - Marketing angle suggestions

### Migration Strategy
1. **New Architecture**:
   ```
   Merchant Portal → FastAPI Gateway → Product Idea MCP → Inventory MCP + Market Data MCP
   ```

2. **Key Components**:
   - **Product Idea MCP**: Core idea generation logic
   - **Inventory MCP**: Merchant's current inventory
   - **Market Data MCP**: Trends and analytics

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - [ ] Create Product Idea MCP
   - [ ] Integrate with inventory system
   - [ ] Add market analysis capabilities
   - [ ] Develop merchant feedback loop

## 3. Virtual Try-On (VTO)

### Current Implementation
- **Location**: `src/ai/flows/virtual-try-on.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Image processing
  - Virtual product placement
  - Realistic rendering

### Goals
1. **Seamless Integration**
   - Work across devices
   - Support multiple product categories
   - Fast rendering

2. **Enhanced Realism**
   - Better lighting/shadow handling
   - Accurate sizing
   - Multiple angle views

3. **Performance**
   - Quick processing
   - Low resource usage
   - Offline capabilities

### Migration Strategy
1. **New Architecture**:
   ```
   Mobile App/Web → CDN → FastAPI Gateway → VTO MCP → Product Catalog MCP
   ```

2. **Key Components**:
   - **VTO MCP**: Core image processing
   - **Product Catalog MCP**: 3D models and assets
   - **CDN**: Asset delivery

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - [ ] Create VTO MCP
   - [ ] Optimize 3D assets
   - [ ] Implement client-side rendering
   - [ ] Add analytics

## 4. Implementation Roadmap
