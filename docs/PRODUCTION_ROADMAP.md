# TAIC Platform: Production Roadmap

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to transition the TAIC platform from its current state to a fully functional production-ready system, focusing on real-world use cases and removing simulation references.

## Core Vision

TAIC is a global e-commerce platform powered by blockchain technology that:

1. **Enables Global Merchants** - Allows entrepreneurs and existing businesses worldwide to create merchant accounts, upload products, and set prices
2. **Integrates Crypto Payments** - Supports TAIC cryptocurrency as the primary payment method with fiat currency equivalents
3. **Offers Cashback Rewards** - Provides cashback in TAIC cryptocurrency to incentivize purchases
4. **Leverages AI** - Uses AI assistants to enhance the shopping experience and product discovery

## Current Status Assessment

### Functional Components
