## Phase 4: User Experience & AI (6-8 Weeks)

### 4.0 AI Agent Architecture Strategy (New)

To realize the vision of a sophisticated AI-enhanced shopping experience, the TAIC platform will adopt a new AI agent architecture based on modern, scalable technologies:

-   **FastAPI Backend for AI Agents:** All AI agent logic (Shopping Assistant, Merchant-specific agents, Gift Recommendation, Admin agents, etc.) will be developed as services using the FastAPI framework. This provides a robust, high-performance Python-based backend.
-   **MCPUs Library for Agent Capabilities:** The `MCPUs` library will be leveraged to enable agents to expose their functionalities as "tools" (MCP-compatible) and to consume tools offered by other agents or services. This promotes modularity and interoperability.
-   **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication:** A core principle will be A2A communication, allowing specialized agents to collaborate. For instance, the main AI Shopping Assistant will query individual Merchant Agents (each an MCP server) for product information, inventory, or promotions.
-   **Phased Implementation:**
    -   **Phase A (Foundation):** Establish the core FastAPI backend, develop the initial AI Shopping Assistant, and create foundational product data access tools.
    -   **Phase B (Merchant Integration):** Develop Merchant Agents (starting with a CJ Dropshipping Agent) and implement A2A communication between the Shopping Assistant and Merchant Agents.
    -   **Phase C (Advanced Capabilities):** Roll out advanced features like conversational discovery, style advisors, personalized recommendations, and the Gift Recommendation Agent, all built on the new architecture.
    -   **Phase D (Admin & Maturity):** Extend AI to administrative tasks, implement a robust memory layer for agents, and scale the ecosystem.

This strategic shift aims to create a flexible, powerful, and maintainable AI system capable of delivering a truly intelligent and personalized e-commerce experience. The following AI-related roadmap items will be implemented leveraging this new architecture.
