# Active Context: TAIC - Legal Page Population

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** June 9, 2025

## 1. Current Work Focus

*   **Primary Task:** Professionally populating critical legal and informational pages for the TAIC platform.
*   **Current Phase:** Content implementation for core legal documents using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Specific Pages Recently Addressed/Created:**
    *   Merchant Agreement (`/app/legal/merchant-agreement/page.tsx`)
    *   Refund & Returns Policy (`/app/legal/refund-policy/page.tsx`)
    *   Fees & Payouts Schedule (`/app/legal/fee-schedule/page.tsx`)

## 2. Recent Changes & Implementations

*   **Merchant Agreement:** Populated with comprehensive terms for sellers, including sections on account setup, product listing, order fulfillment, fees (linking to the new Fee Schedule page), customer service, IP, termination, and disclaimers. Placeholders for 'Last Updated' date and 'Jurisdiction' included.
*   **Refund & Returns Policy:** Populated with detailed guidelines for customer refunds and returns, covering eligibility, non-returnable items, process, TAIC Coin refunds, and dispute resolution. Placeholder for 'Last Updated' date included.
*   **Fees & Payouts Schedule:** Created and populated this new page, detailing merchant fees (commission, TAIC Coin fees, listing fees, etc.) and payout processes (method, currency, frequency, threshold). Includes a fee table and placeholders for 'Last Updated' date and specific rates.
*   **Styling:** Consistent use of Tailwind CSS for professional and readable layouts across all new pages.
*   **Component Structure:** Utilized a `<Section>` component for consistent page structure and `<FeeTable>` component for the fee schedule page.
*   **Internal Linking:** Ensured relevant internal links between legal documents (e.g., Merchant Agreement links to Fee Schedule, Terms of Service, Privacy Policy; Fee Schedule links back to Merchant Agreement).

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate & Short-Term)

*   **Populate Remaining Legal/Informational Pages:** Based on the project plan (e.g., if any other specific policies are pending from the user's guide).
*   **Review and Finalize Placeholders:** Systematically go through all populated pages and ensure placeholders for dates (e.g., "[Insert Last Updated Date Here - e.g., June 9, 2025]"), jurisdiction, contact emails, and specific fee rates are clearly marked for future replacement with actual values.
*   **Footer and Navigation Updates:** Ensure all newly created legal pages are correctly linked in the site's footer and any relevant navigation menus.
*   **Legal Review Preparation:** Consolidate all legal content, noting that it's prepared for formal legal review for compliance and accuracy.
*   **Memory Bank Initialization:** Completed the creation of core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

*   **Content Source:** All content for legal pages is being provided by the USER from a guide.
*   **Styling Consistency:** Maintaining a uniform, professional look and feel using Tailwind CSS is a priority.
*   **Placeholder Management:** Using clear, bracketed placeholders (e.g., `[Placeholder for X]`) for dynamic or to-be-confirmed information.
*   **Accessibility:** While not explicitly tested yet, aiming for readable and well-structured content.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (from this session)

*   **Page Structure:** Using a common `<Section>` component for consistent layout of content sections within pages.
*   **Data Presentation:** Using a `<FeeTable>` component for structured display of fee information.
*   **Clarity in Legal Text:** Structuring content with clear headings, bullet points, and paragraphs for better readability.
*   **Internal Navigation:** Using Next.js `<Link>` component for all internal site navigation.

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights (from this session)

*   The process of populating content pages is systematic: view placeholder, replace with detailed content, ensure styling, add links, and manage placeholders.
*   Creating new pages sometimes requires creating parent directories first if they don't exist (`fee-schedule` example).
*   The Memory Bank is crucial for maintaining context, especially when initializing it for the first time.
