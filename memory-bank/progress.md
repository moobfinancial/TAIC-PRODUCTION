    *   Created `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, and `progress.md` with initial content reflecting the current project state.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Implement (Next Steps)

*   **Populate Remaining Legal/Informational Pages (if any):** Confirm with USER if any other specific policies or informational pages are pending from their guide.
*   **Finalize Placeholders:**
    *   Replace all `[Insert Last Updated Date Here - e.g., June 9, 2025]` placeholders with actual dates.
    *   Replace `[Your Jurisdiction, e.g., the State of Florida, USA]` in Merchant Agreement and Terms of Service.
    *   Replace `[DPO Contact Email]` in Privacy Policy.
    *   Replace specific fee rates/payout details in Fees & Payouts Schedule (e.g., `[e.g., 5%]`, `[e.g., $50 USD]`, `[e.g., weekly, bi-weekly, monthly]`).
    *   Address placeholder for cookie consent management tool in Cookie Policy.
*   **Functional Features (as per Project Brief & previous checkpoints):**
    *   Cookie consent management tool integration.
    *   Help Center search functionality (backend and frontend).
    *   Newsletter signup backend API and frontend integration.
*   **Footer and Navigation Updates:** Systematically ensure all created legal and informational pages are correctly linked in the site's footer and any relevant navigation menus.
*   **Content Review and Finalization:**
    *   Legal review of all legal content for compliance and accuracy.
    *   General content review for clarity, grammar, and consistency.
*   **Testing and Accessibility:**
    *   Test responsiveness, accessibility (WCAG), and cross-browser compatibility of all pages.

## 3. Current Status

*   A significant portion of the platform's foundational legal and informational content is now in place and styled.
*   The Memory Bank has been successfully initialized, providing a structured way to maintain project context.
*   The immediate next steps involve addressing any remaining content pages and systematically resolving all placeholders.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

*   None directly related to content population. Blockers for functional features (e.g., backend for newsletter) are separate and noted in 'What's Left to Build'.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Decision to create a dedicated `Fees & Payouts Schedule` page, linked from the `Merchant Agreement`.
*   Established a consistent structure for Memory Bank files.

This document will track the overall progress of the TAIC platform development.
