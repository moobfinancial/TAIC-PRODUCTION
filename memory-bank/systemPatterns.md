# System Patterns: TAIC - The AI E-commerce Platform

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** June 9, 2025

## 1. System Architecture Overview (Conceptual)

TAIC employs a modern, decoupled architecture:
*   **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router) client-side application responsible for UI/UX, user interaction, and presentation logic. Interacts with backend APIs.
*   **Backend API Layer:** (To be detailed) A set of APIs (likely REST or GraphQL) that serve as the intermediary between the frontend and core backend services. Handles business logic, data processing, and orchestration.
*   **Core Backend Services:**
    *   **User Management Service:** Handles authentication, authorization, profiles.
    *   **Product Catalog Service:** Manages product information, categories, inventory.
    *   **Order Management Service:** Processes orders, payments, fulfillment tracking.
    *   **AI Services:** A suite of microservices or integrated modules providing AI functionalities (recommendations, search, NLP for support, etc.).
    *   **Blockchain Integration Service:** Interfaces with the Fantom blockchain for TAIC Coin transactions, wallet operations, and potentially smart contract interactions.
*   **Database(s):** (To be detailed) Likely a combination of SQL and NoSQL databases optimized for different data types and access patterns (e.g., PostgreSQL for transactional data, a document store for product catalogs).
*   **Fantom Blockchain:** External decentralized ledger for TAIC Coin transactions.

## 2. Key Technical Decisions (Current & Foreseen)

*   **Frontend Framework:** Next.js with App Router for its features like server components, routing, and performance optimizations.
*   **Language:** TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience across the stack.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, enabling rapid UI development and consistency.
*   **Blockchain Platform:** Fantom for its speed, low transaction costs, and EVM compatibility (for TAIC Coin).
*   **API Design:** (To be decided - REST or GraphQL) Focus on clear contracts, versioning, and security.

## 3. Design Patterns in Use (Frontend Focus)

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** Leveraging React/Next.js for building reusable UI components.
*   **State Management:** (To be refined - Context API, Zustand, Redux Toolkit) For managing application state effectively.
*   **Utility-First CSS:** With Tailwind CSS.
*   **Responsive Design:** Ensuring adaptability across various screen sizes.
*   **Client-Side Routing:** Managed by Next.js App Router.
*   **Server Components & Client Components:** Utilizing Next.js App Router capabilities for optimal rendering strategies.
*   **Atomic Design Principles (Conceptual):** Structuring components into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages for maintainability and scalability (can be adapted).

## 4. Component Relationships (High-Level Examples)

*   `Layout` components provide overall page structure (header, footer, navigation).
*   `Page` components (e.g., `HomePage`, `ProductDetailsPage`) orchestrate various smaller components.
*   `Feature` components (e.g., `ProductCard`, `ShoppingCart`, `CheckoutForm`) encapsulate specific functionalities.
*   `UI` components (e.g., `Button`, `Input`, `Modal`) are basic building blocks.
*   `LegalPageLayout` (custom or shared) used for consistent styling of legal and informational pages.

## 5. Critical Implementation Paths

*   **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure and robust implementation is paramount.
*   **Payment Gateway Integration (Fiat & TAIC Coin):** Complex and security-sensitive.
*   **Blockchain Interaction:** Securely managing wallets, signing transactions, and interacting with smart contracts.
*   **AI Feature Integration:** Ensuring seamless and effective incorporation of AI models and services.
*   **Database Design & ORM:** Scalable and efficient data storage and retrieval.
*   **API Security:** Protecting against common web vulnerabilities.
